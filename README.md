- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedPipper
- 👀 I'm interested in many things, but I enjoy playing around with linux, low-level stuff, algorithms and hopefully, in the future, AI and Big Data.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of how computers work at their core and I'm having the time of my life. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project.
- 📫 How to reach me: stefan21nastasa@gmail.com
